# spinnersAndAlerts
Practicing Creating Alerts and the Animated Spinner in iOS
* So I'm about to start a project involving uploading images to an app using an iOS interface, 
and I wanted to practice givng the user a confirmation message alert and giving them a 'wait' 
prompt when they interact with the app.
* It's pretty simple. You can choose between three buttons (IBACTION) and can see the alerts, 
or if you press "Pause App" you can see the activityIndicator prompting the user to wait as it
completes an action. You can press "Restore App" to end the activity indicator. 
* I don't like being subtle, and I wanted to make the 'spinner' to be x = 100 and y = 100
but iOS doesn't like that for some reason. Will try to figure it out. 
*Anyway, enjoy the images, and on to the next project of actually logging into stuff 
within iOS.
